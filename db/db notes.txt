The recurrence rule structure supports:
   - frequency: 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'yearly'
   - interval: number of units (e.g., every 2 weeks)
   - dayOfWeek: for weekly recurrence
   - dayOfMonth: for monthly/yearly recurrence
   - monthOfYear: for yearly recurrence

Example: 
{
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "interval": 1,
  "dayOfMonth": 1
}
