### Enhanced Goals and Requirements

### Primary Use Case

The main purpose of the database is to track personal financial activities, including expenditures, earnings, and their respective timings. The database schema includes tables for users, categories, transaction groups, transactions, recurring transactions, audit logs, imports, and deleted records to support comprehensive financial management.

### User Interaction

Users will interact with the system through both a web interface and a mobile app. The system will support user authentication, role management, and various financial operations.

### Reporting and Analytics

While there are no specific reports identified initially, the goal is to include a wide variety of information types and reports to provide comprehensive insights. The database schema supports detailed transaction tracking, categorization, and grouping, which can be leveraged for generating various financial reports and analytics.

### Scalability and Performance

The system is expected to support a maximum of 5 users initially. The database design includes indexes, constraints, and efficient data types to ensure good performance. Any recommendations for upgrades to handle potential future growth should be communicated.

### Security and Compliance

There are no specific security or compliance requirements initially, but the database schema includes secure storage of user credentials (password hashes) and supports role-based access control. Suggestions for enhancing security, such as data encryption and regular audits, are welcome.

### Integration with Other Systems

There are no plans for integrating the database with other systems or services at this time. However, the schema includes an imports table to support potential future data import functionalities.
