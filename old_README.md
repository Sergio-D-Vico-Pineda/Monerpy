Notes:
The existing `README.md` <cite repo="Sergio-D-Vico-Pineda/Monerpy" path="README.md" start="1-48" end="1-48" /> provides basic Astro project information and commands, but it lacks specific details about the Monerpy application itself. The information provided in this answer is derived from the `Monerpy Overview` wiki page and the `suggestions.txt` file <cite repo="Sergio-D-Vico-Pineda/Monerpy" path="suggestions.txt" start="1-159" end="1-159" />, which outline the project's purpose, technology stack, architecture, and potential future features. The `package.json` file <cite repo="Sergio-D-Vico-Pineda/Monerpy" path="package.json" start="1-37" end="1-37" /> also provides details on project scripts and author information.
