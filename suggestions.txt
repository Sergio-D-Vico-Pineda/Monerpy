For the authorization suggestions I mentioned, here are some options we could implement later:

Rate limiting for API endpoints
Transaction amount limits/approvals
Two-factor authentication for large transactions
IP-based access controls
Audit logging (already in schema)

Would you like me to implement any of these now?
